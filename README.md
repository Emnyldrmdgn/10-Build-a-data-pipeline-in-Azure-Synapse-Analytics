# Build-a-data-pipeline-in-Azure-Synapse-Analytics
The source data for this exercise is a text file containing product data. The destination is a table in a dedicated SQL pool. Your goal is to create a pipeline that encapsulates a data flow in which the product data in the file is loaded into the table; inserting new products and updating existing ones.


## Overview

In this lab, you will build and execute a data pipeline in **Azure Synapse Analytics**. The pipeline will use a **Data Flow** to load **product data** into a table in a **dedicated SQL pool** (formerly known as SQL Data Warehouse).

This exercise demonstrates how to orchestrate data transformation and loading operations using Synapse pipelines and provides hands-on experience with Synapse Studio and Synapse Analytics Explorer.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create and configure a data pipeline in Synapse Analytics.
- Design a Data Flow to transform and load data.
- Load product data into a table in a dedicated SQL Pool.
- Trigger and monitor the execution of the pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the lab, ensure the following:

- An Azure Synapse workspace is available and accessible.
- A dedicated SQL pool has been created and is running.
- Sample product data is available in your Data Lake or Blob Storage.
- Synapse Studio access (through Synapse Analytics Explorer).
